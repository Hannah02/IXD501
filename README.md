# IXD501


# Research

## [Three initial ideas](https://github.com/Hannah02/major_project_ideas)

## ["Quail and Pancetta", my 501 research blog](hannahsharp.co.uk/blog)

This includes research such as:

* Talking to people who can help with my project

* Qualititve survey results

* Class feedback and how it has shaped my brand

## User Personas-

* [User Persona 1](/UserProfileElla.png)
This the primary audience for my book.

* [User Persona 2](/UserProfileNatasha.png)
This is a profile that I created before doing the survey. After doing the survey, I don't think that this represents a major section of my audience.

* [User Persona 3](/UserProfileJonathan.png)
This persona is based off the survey responses from men who, were on the whole, quite supportive of this idea. I feel that in order to create a more equal playing field within the deisgn industry, we all need to work together so I hope to engage men in my work too. 

* [User Persona 4](/UserProfileSam.png)
I created this persona based on the responses of the person who is non-binary who replied to my survey. At least 0.4%, or 1 in 250 people identify as non-binary, so although they do not make up a large percentage of my audience, when we are talking about gender so specifically I think it is important to plan for all audiences as greater gender equality has the potential to benefit everyone.

## [User Stories](https://trello.com/invite/b/wEfYgnus/71248578e93632a045938c2945e8d537/final-year) I created as part of an ongoing Trello board.



# Prototypes

## [Style Guide](/Layout.png) for the book.

## [MailChimp landing page](https://mailchi.mp/14e84654482b/makeyourmark) that will be expanded with more content as I create it.

## [A rough draft of the Kicksarter content](/KickstarterInfo.pdf) that will be updated as I am able to get more concrete pricing on specific areas of the project.
